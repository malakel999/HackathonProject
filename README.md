# Interactive Educational Platform for Learning about the Solar System and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)

## Platform Overview

Our platform serves as an interactive hub for learning about the solar system and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). The educational content is enriched through 3D visualizations of celestial bodies and engaging activities designed to reinforce learning. By integrating HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with the Vue.js framework, we provide a user-friendly interface that encourages exploration and interaction.

## NASA Data Integration

We leverage real-time data from NASAâ€™s resources to ensure our content is both accurate and up-to-date. This data underpins our educational materials and predictive AI model, forming the backbone of the learning experience by offering users detailed information about planets, comets, and asteroids.
